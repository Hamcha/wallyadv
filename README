- BUILDING FROM SOURCE -

Wally's Grand Adventure source is written in Moonscript, but has to be compiled
to LUA to be executed by WALLY.EXE.

A simple "make all" should compile all files needed.
You will need Moonscript installed.
Instructions for installation on your operating system of choice are available
on the ARPANET @ HTTP://MOONSCRIPT.ORG (Optimized for NCSA Mosaic)

- FOR THOSE LIVING IN THE FUTURE -

If your computer is too new you can give ./run.sh a go, it requires DOSBOX
(./run.bat on MICROSOFT® WINDOWS™ 9X and NT)
Be sure to have compiled all files or downloaded a precompiled release!
